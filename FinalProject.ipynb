    "This project uses datasets from the WPRDC to determine the best neighborhood in Pittsburgh. Our metric to determine \"best\" is the most family friendly. This is determined by looking at the number of playgrounds, number of car crashes, and . In order to quantify our data, we used a point system. Each person looked at their dataset and categorized each neighborhood as \"excellent\", \"good\", \"okay\", or \"poor\". \"Excellent\" received 4 points, \"good\" receieved 3 points, \"okay\" received 2 points, and \"poor\" received 1 point. To combine these metrics, the points from each dataset were added up and the neighborhood with the best "

Neighborhoods were categorized into four categories: 1-poor, 2-average, 3-good, and 4-excellent in our orginal datasets and the final metric categories are as follows where \"x\" is the combined score of the neighborhood: x<6-poor, 5<x<8-average, 7<x<10-good, 9<x<13excellent . The corresponding datasets for our metrics are \"Pittsburgh Police Arrests Data\", \"Pittsburgh Playground Equipment\", and \"City of Pittsburgh Facilities\"."
